## Docker Configs

Here we have a set of configuration files for running JupyterHub as a Docker container. The configuration files are based on the upstream [JupyterHub base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/).

These configurations are not complete and are intended to be used as a starting point for creating a custom JupyterHub Docker image or for testing JupyterHub.

For intance, the `jupyterhub_config.py` file is not complete and will need to be updated with the appropriate settings for your environment.
